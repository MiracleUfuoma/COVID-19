# COVID-19
Using SQL to analyze covid-19 datasets
In this project,I was able to get datasets of the covid-19 virus from kaggles and I analyzed on the SQL server.
I also found meaningful insights like:
1.   The country with the highest number of cases.
2.   The country with the lowest number of cases.
3.   The survival rate of each country.
4.   The total numer of deaths in each countries.
